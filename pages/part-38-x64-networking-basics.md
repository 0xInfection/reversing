<h1>Part 38 - x64 Networking Basics</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover.Â https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>So... What does an x64 server or computer actually understand? 0100010100100100101010 and many more...</p><p>A small level above that we are at machine code which is a series of hex digits which translate into machine instructions and/or data.</p><p>With the C programming language, we created a construct to more easily create programs to communicate with the hardware. C is the Grandfather of almost every programming language in modern existence.</p><p>C abstracts away the x64 binary of 010101000101001011 or machine code of 0x90 0x45 0x22 0x22 or assembly mov rax, 0x222323123, etc...</p><p>Next we create our first real C program!</p>
