Let's re-examine our code.

<pre spellcheck="false">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(void) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;int myNumber = 16;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;int myNewNumber = myNumber--;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; myNewNumber &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; myNumber &lt;&lt; std::endl;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}
</pre>

We see our very simple C++ code above to which we are doing nothing more than assigning a number into a variable to which we init another int variable and assign the original variable to which it is post-decremented. We then output each value to the terminal.

Let's debug.

<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="/imgs/1532085310684.jpg"/></div>

It is clear that the value for the post-decrement operator gets loaded into __r1__ at __main+68 __so let's break at __main+72__.

<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="/imgs/1532085326445.jpg"/></div>

We can clearly see that __r1 __does in fact hold the value of __15__ to which was decremented from our original value.
