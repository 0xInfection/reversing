<h1>Part 21 - How To Compile A Program</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Let’s look again at last weeks C program and take a deeper look at how we turn that source code into an executable file.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-middle"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGP6GCX02SLOg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520461365362?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=GehNWbfKhc8rqyZ_Gsk46MrzV21OrEQR18E-47BSiXg"/></div><p>To compile this program in C, we simply type:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGBu4p6ZvYGWA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520190744251?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Qh3jAoLAjE-EOJEaGxY-S3-Z4g__3HBEN3F45-WQ9LQ"/></div><p>This single step will create <strong>exit.o</strong> which is the binary object file and <strong>exit</strong> which is the binary executable file.</p><p>If we wanted to convert this C source code to Assembly, we need to use the GNU compiler in the below fashion. Lets start by running the below command in the terminal:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEyj0GWTprBMQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520193559694?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=VkWkjCePWY1iglbh7D_ia63z7ZRJfRj5QzRom9ASoeI"/></div><p>Let’s begin with the -S switch. The -S switch will create comparable AT&amp;T Syntax Assembly source code. The -m32 will create a 32-bit executable and the -O0 will tell the compiler how much optimization to use when compiling the binary. That is the capital O and the numeric 0. Numeric 0 in that case means no optimization which means it is at the most human readable instruction set. If you were to substitute a 1, 2 or 3 the amount of optimization increases as the values go up.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFiK0eE9QCVqA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520230747774?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=6s5UcPhVlmodq1NW7bTRCZWcRWG47MF3plrYptGcYbQ"/></div><p>This step above creates exit.s which is the equivalent Assembly Language source code as we mentioned above.</p><p>We then need to compile the Assembly source code into a binary object file which will generate a <strong>exit.o</strong> file.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQE7hRqugKLvvA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520191376275?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=-omIwmoR4ahLPkNbXSPFDzZ61toEg82xTgtpsi0MSlE"/></div><p>Finally we need to use a linker to create the actual binary executable code from the binary object file which will create an executable called exit. </p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG-BjhJCC50jg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520231891958?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=lpAvrwKbDnkNl0oQEgDNll7-sO4hUDkvwX3ZWIAibe8"/></div><p>Last week when we examined the executable file exit in a program called objdump, and examined the main area we saw the following below except this time we will use AT&amp;T Assembly Language Syntax:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEcb_FuZhn22Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520461365373?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=MqMb07Ng5bw1UNKzYNlB_Xjf8QBwNKKRCzTc6F6alWU"/></div><p>This command above will create the following output below:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFj08db0fqejg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520142510413?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=e0Ox4LPHn45fVT_ZNV9z678scCOSvusFtDv0fxZm7rE"/></div><p>Lets examine the code in the debugger. Let’s start GDB which is the GNU debugger and first list the source code by typing l, then set a breakpoint on main and run the program. Finally we will disassemble and review the output below:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGSwZLDVLkcXw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520461365667?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=OjMVqRr1Ox6MpcWtmxG4EizwTjHhZ6e8pOg7xgsnjnQ"/></div><p>In each of the three above examinations, you will essentially see the same set of instructions which we will take a deeper look as to what is exactly going on in future tutorials.</p><p>Throughout this tutorial series thus far we have been looking at Intel Syntax Assembly Language. We are going to turn our focus to AT&amp;T Syntax as I have stated above as this is the natural syntax utilized in Linux with the GNU Assembler and GNU Debugger.</p><p>The biggest different you will see is that in AT&amp;T Syntax, the source and destinations are reversed.</p><p>AT&amp;T Syntax : <strong>movl %esp, %ebp</strong> [This means move esp into ebp.]</p><p>Intel Syntax : <strong>mov esp, ebp</strong> [This means move ebp into esp.]</p><p>You will also see some additional variances as AT&amp;T uses additional variances which we will cover in a later tutorial.</p><p>If we wanted to create a pure Assembly Code program which does the same thing above we would type:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHHW1SARWXbwg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520248174155?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=l19IMSg2mU__CzVtQdmFMsi9kMJReocf8ckwiISHqlY"/></div><p>To compile this we would use the GAS Assembler and Linker:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHQV0qdoWzRSw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520170234389?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=WwHfqUDYzb1Rda2hNdmYCyg5TKoOdw6AvRmyvzf9EcA"/></div><p>To run any executable in Linux you type ./ and the name of the binary executable. In this case we type ./exit and press return. When we do so, nothing happens. That is good as all we did was create a program that exited to the OS.</p><p>I look forward to seeing you all next week when we dive into more assembly code!</p>
