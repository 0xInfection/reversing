<h1>Part 17 - ADDS</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>ADDS is the same as ADD except it sets the flags accordingly in the CPSR.</p><p>Let’s look at an example to illustrate:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFD3TOMO8WqXQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520241718373?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ptVf0I35SbNxRENxAm8818_AK7FOEbhUcyWNTDvmxmA"/></div><p>We <strong>add</strong> <strong>100</strong> decimal into <strong>r1</strong>, <strong>4,294,967,295</strong> into <strong>r2</strong>. We then <strong>add r1</strong> and <strong>r2</strong> and place in <strong>r0.</strong></p><p>We see <strong>adds </strong>which sets the flags in the CPSR. We have to remember when we debug in GDB, the value of the CPSR is in hex. In order to see what flags are set, we must convert the hex to binary. This will make sense as we start to debug and hack this example in the coming tutorials.</p><p>You can compile the above by:</p><pre spellcheck="false">as -o adc.o adc.s
ld -o adc adc.o
</pre><p>We need to remember that bits 31, 20, 29 and 28 in the CPSR indicate the following:</p><p><strong>bit 31 - N = Negative Flag</strong></p><p><strong>bit 30 - Z = Zero Flag</strong></p><p><strong>bit 29 - C = Carry Flag</strong></p><p><strong>bit 28 - V = Overflow Flag</strong></p><p>Therefore if the value in binary was <strong>0110</strong> of bit 31, 30, 29 and 28 (<strong>NZCV</strong>) that would mean:</p><p><strong>Negative Flag NOT Set</strong></p><p><strong>Zero Flag SET</strong></p><p><strong>Carry Flag SET</strong></p><p><strong>Overflow Flag NOT Set </strong></p><p>It is critical that you compile, debug and hack each exercise in order to understand what is going on here.</p><p>Next week we will dive into Debugging ADDS.</p>
