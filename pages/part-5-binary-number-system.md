## Part 5: Binary Number System

Binary numbers are what define the core of a computer. A bit within a computer is either on or off. A bit has either electricity turned on to it or it is absent of such. We will dive into this deeper in future tutorials.&nbsp;

Puzzled and confused, where do we go from here?

Have no fear! The binary number system is here! It is important to understand that in binary, each column has a value two times the column to its right and there are only two digits in the base which happen to be 0 and 1.

In decimal, base 10, say we have the number 15 which means (1 x 10) + (5 x 1) = 15 therefore the 5 is the number times 1 and the 1 is that number times 10.

Binary works in a similar fashion however we are now referring to base 2. That same number in binary is 1111. To illustrate:&nbsp;

Binary numbers are important because using them instead of the decimal system simplifies the design of computers and related technologies. The simplest definition of the binary number system is a system of numbering that uses only two digits, as we mentioned above, to represent numbers necessary for a computer architecture&nbsp;rather than using the digits 1 through 9 plus 0 to represent such.

In our next lesson we discuss the hexadecimal number system. It only gets more exciting from here!
