<h1>Part 5 – Word Lengths</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>The system on chip we are working with has a 32-bit ARM CPU. 32-bits is actually 4 bytes of information which make up a word.</p><p>If you remember my prior tutorial on x86 Assembly, a word was 16-bits. Every different architecture defines a word differently.</p><p>The most significant bit of a word for our ARM CPU is located at bit 31 therefore a carry is generated if an overflow occurs there.</p><p>The lowest address in our architecture starts at 0x00000000 and goes to 0xFFFFFFFF. The processor sees memory in word blocks therefore every 4 bytes. A memory address associated with the start of a word is referred to as a word boundary and is divisible by 4. For example here is our first word:</p><pre spellcheck="false">0x00000000
0x00000004
0x00000008
0x0000000C
</pre><p>So why is this important? There is the concept of fetching and executing to which the processor deals with instructions to which it must work in this fashion for proper execution.</p><p>Before we dive into coding assembly it is critical that you understand some basics of how the CPU operates. There will be a number of more lectures going over the framework so I appreciate everyone hanging in there!</p><p>Next week we will dive into registers! Stay tuned!</p>
