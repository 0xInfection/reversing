<h1>Part 4 - Number Systems</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Binary addition can occur in one of four different fashions:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEHGI2NtcbEpw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1536919520880?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=g5nDW8-pjzrtS-zceS15nmDthMX0K0FSCSvkG--z_jE"/></div><p>Keep in mind the (1) means a carry bit. It very simply means an overflow.</p><p>Lets take the following 4-bit nibble example:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEuxTFAbWL4pg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1536919547320?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=H8qaDhoHP1j9uJo-G3YozEuy_pQDj-EvxHqUK1cttkQ"/></div><p>We see an obvious carry in the 3rd bit. If the 8th bit had a carry then this would generate a carry flag within the CPU.</p><p>Let’s examine an 8-bit number:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGZ7rS85AhNJg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1536919574450?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ky71UsTeRPpgjoXtyPONCvZAD-IG8pUrPf5UqSXx0Z4"/></div><p>If we had:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEcKfjjIlVIBQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1536919592305?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=xPWOuFkAYw-aIBMVc7xIBg9zB4IzV6KAEoUc8-Wl30A"/></div><p>Here we see a carry bit which would trigger the carry flag within the CPU to be 1 or true. We will discuss the carry flag in later tutorials. Please just keep in mind this example to reference as it is very important to understand.</p><p>Next week we will dive into binary subtraction! Stay tuned!</p>
