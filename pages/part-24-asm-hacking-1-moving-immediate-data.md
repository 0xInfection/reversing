<h1>Part 24 - ASM Hacking 1 [Moving Immediate Data]</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Let’s begin by loading the binary into GDB.</p><p>To load into GDB type:</p><p><strong>gdb -q moving_immediate_data</strong></p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGmxUkcxGlQFg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520534645555?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=gbsmxaezbk1B_4xKcmhpV97wT732t2DC3c7xjgFd9ck"/></div><p>Let’s first set a breakpoint on start by typing <strong>b _start</strong>.</p><p>We can then run the program by typing <strong>r</strong>.</p><p>To then begin disassembly, we simply type <strong>disas</strong>.</p><p>We coded a <strong>nop</strong> which means no operation or <strong>0x90</strong> from an OPCODE perspective for proper debugging purposes which the breakpoint properly hit. This is good practice when creating assembly programs.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGZBzT7jIhTSw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520241969888?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=g1r1dORRYM8-7n-Q_V5pd-7kjr4EHfJKKGWp5sckDXc"/></div><p>Lets have some fun! At this point lets <strong>si</strong> once and do an <strong>i r</strong> to see that<strong> 0x64</strong> has in fact been moved into <strong>EAX</strong>.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG2mmq0T4sx3Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520148350561?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=UePLiVw5TluwehUCLzeJKsRurClCyRq_0DlKIiqF_40"/></div><p>We can see <strong>EAX</strong> has the value of <strong>0x64</strong> or <strong>100</strong> decimal. Lets HACK that value now by setting <strong>EAX</strong> to say something like <strong>0x66</strong> by typing <strong>set $eax = 0x66</strong>.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGXO_j1-YdTug/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520194300522?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=O3X7YMmK2us1RC1qwDdhLtnkWhziQ5JH0iLQKdj6lAY"/></div><p>BAM! There we go! You can see the ULTIMATE power of assembly here! We just hacked the value from <strong>0x64</strong> to <strong>0x66</strong> or <strong>100</strong> to <strong>102</strong> decimal. This is a trivial example however you can clearly see when you learn to master these concepts you develop a greater power over the computer. With each program that we create, we will have a very simple lesson like this where we will hijack at least one portion of the code so we can not only see how the program is created and debugged but how we can manipulate it to whatever we want.</p><p>I look forward to seeing you all next week when we dive into creating our second assembly program!</p>
