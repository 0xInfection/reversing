So... What does an x64 server or computer actually understand? 0100010100100100101010 and many more...

A small level above that we are at machine code which is a series of hex digits which translate into machine instructions and/or data.

With the C programming language, we created a construct to more easily create programs to communicate with the hardware. C is the Grandfather of almost every programming language in modern existence.

C abstracts away the x64 binary of 010101000101001011 or machine code of 0x90 0x45 0x22 0x22 or assembly mov rax, 0x222323123, etc...

Next we create our first real C program!
