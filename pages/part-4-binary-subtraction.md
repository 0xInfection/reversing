<h1>Part 4 – Binary Subtraction</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Binary subtraction is nothing more than adding the negative value of the number to be subtracted. For example 8 + - 4, the starting point would be zero to which we move 8 points in the positive direction and then four points in the negative direction yielding a value of 4.</p><p>We represent a sign bit in binary to which bit 7 indicates the sign of number where 0 is positive and 1 is negative.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG30nevMsazhw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520215170654?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=oVIR51Ky-1MADecPdYCHvfWVl081djccZg5Z1P-B7AY"/></div><p>The above would represent -2.</p><p>We utilize the concept of twos compliment which inverts each bit and then finally adding 1.</p><p>Lets examine binary 2.</p><p><strong>00000010</strong></p><p>Invert the bits.</p><p><strong>11111101</strong></p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQF9y2SxkAS99A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520247605526?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=XP6ySCspvMwulc0loNSMaaXBT_DlGer1YpK2F3NxRl4"/></div><p>Let’s examine a subtraction operation:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQH-w6UWv5kACQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520212177447?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=B-NrbMB0ARfVf7vNYrEEYNEd63DWI82YE2Jm4LdgAEI"/></div><p>So what is the (1) you may ask, that is the overflow bit. In future tutorials we will examine what we refer to as the overflow flag and carry flag.</p><p>Next week we will dive into word lengths! Stay tuned!</p>
