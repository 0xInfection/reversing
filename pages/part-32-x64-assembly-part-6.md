We are simply setting a char byte length and setting a new string.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEEaDkAAZehvA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1553853373225?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=iOb86Sh62beuI0R7Tgdfhs2tGqtTmRYv9PzDv-U4D5Q"/></div><p>As we can see we have successfully altered the string in memory.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFQuIyqZscy5w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1553853413835?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9_l0T8eeqoSGBW-IhUeuJ9-PmO7KliiUHL3aZ4OKzks"/></div><p>We continue and run through the binary and see that our hack continues through <strong>RSI</strong>.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEjZ0vlo3Qn-Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1553853461475?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=QWA6HzLFBdnZJDMj9Oez3_mrjJcaE6evkAKKnXopGr8"/></div><p>Finally we see when we run the binary we have successfully hacked it's operation. This is a very simple example however shows the power of truly understanding assembly at this level. GUI debugger tools will also provide this functionality however I like to use the command line tools so that they could be used on every environment.</p><p>The purpose of these tools is to UNDERSTAND how this is done and what to look for when you are professionally reversing in real-time. You need to understand how an attacker can alter memory and/or instructions. We need more professional RE's to help defend infrastructures throughout the world and hopefully these tutorials motivate you toward a career in such.</p>
