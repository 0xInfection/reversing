<h1>Part 43 - Hacking Pointers!</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover.  https://github.com/mytechnotalent/hacking_c-_arm64</p><p>Why C++?  I primarily develop in Python professionally as an Automator however with every day passing we see another Ransomware attack that further cripples society in a catastrophic way.</p><p>This course is a comprehensive series where we learn every facet of C++ and how it relates to the ARM 64 architecture as we will reverse engineer each step in ARM 64 assembly language to get a full understanding of the environment.</p><p>There are roughly over 2,000 hacks a day world-wide and so few who truly understand how the hacks are executed on a fundamental level.  This course is going to take a very basic and step-by-step approach to understanding low-level architecture as it relates to the ARM 64.</p><p>In our next lesson we will set up our development environment.</p>
