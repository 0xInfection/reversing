Why C++? I primarily develop in Python professionally as an Automator however with every day passing we see another Ransomware attack that further cripples society in a catastrophic way.

This course is a comprehensive series where we learn every facet of C++ and how it relates to the ARM 64 architecture as we will reverse engineer each step in ARM 64 assembly language to get a full understanding of the environment.

There are roughly over 2,000 hacks a day world-wide and so few who truly understand how the hacks are executed on a fundamental level. This course is going to take a very basic and step-by-step approach to understanding low-level architecture as it relates to the ARM 64.

In our next lesson we will set up our development environment.
