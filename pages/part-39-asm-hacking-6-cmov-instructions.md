<h1>Part 39 - ASM Hacking 6 [CMOV Instructions]</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Let’s bring the binary into gdb.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHpJAkC7Xjz3w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520490808741?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=wx-5Jl_enE7pA4Kcux94a0QAvychylo5qepBaSMlOrk"/></div><p>Let’s now run the binary. We see that the smallest value is 7 which is expected. Our final bit of instruction in this tutorial will teach you how to jump to any part of the execution that you so choose.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEd0Mei_NhyJg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520241582923?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=IsOk8eXP2zPnug7FdiJvx6sIvQaa1e_QvvMEoFgejqk"/></div><p>We <strong>set $eip = 0x080480dd</strong> which is the exit routine. We see now that it bypasses all of the code from the nop instruction when we broke on _start. You now can use this command to jump anywhere inside of any binary within the debugger.</p><p>I look forward to seeing you all next week when we wrap up our tutorial series.</p>
