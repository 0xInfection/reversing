<h1>Part 27 – Debugging Integer Variables</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Let’s review our code. I again want to include the below information from last week’s lesson to emphasize what is going on regarding integers.</p><p>A 32-bit register can store 2^32 different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 4,294,967,295 (2^32 − 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and −2,147,483,648 (−2^31) through 2,147,483,647 (2^31 − 1) for representation as two's complement.</p><p>Keep in mind with 32-bit memory addresses you can directly access a maximum of 4 GB of byte-addressable memory.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEgOmunABZR9Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520217390524?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=aUsuadmkyJCWWdW30FXeB7euTZWFGeswzPZRIGV41o0"/></div><p>Let’s debug!</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQH4lRxHfajGFQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520233314454?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=TNO5iB2UO3mmrUWENN4_7Qjg3O5otY5vur-Tep5jOeE"/></div><p>We see at <strong>main+12 </strong>the address at <strong>0x10730 </strong>loading data into <strong>r3</strong>. Let’s take a closer look.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQH5Z2EDTfO95A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1520192010424?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=hYNEzxqHHW2z_qv1YZXlmhI2Kr7AY7Kz_imkdZuVqTw"/></div><p>When we examine the data inside <strong>0x10730</strong> we clearly see the integer <strong>777</strong> present. When we continue we see <strong>777 </strong>echoed back to the terminal which makes sense as we utilized the <strong>cout</strong> function within c++.#linux #arm #asm #cplusplus #reverseengineering</p><p>Next week we will dive into Hacking Integer Variables.</p>
