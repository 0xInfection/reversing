<h1>Part 26 - Boot Sector Basics [Part 9]</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover.Â https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Today we begin our actual x64 code basics. Over the next few weeks I will create very simple examples so we get a grasp of the x64 architecture. Let's start with a basic code block:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGb0wEJY7MBDw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227269983?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=0IHS_FAXm37VTR4VnM-mAIkxjCYL5g_bw6CFZaZV7ws"/></div><p>We begin by declaring the <strong>.data</strong> section to which all of our global data is stores. If we had a string or some other form of hard coded data it would go in that block. In our example we will leave it empty.</p><p>The <strong>.text</strong> section declares where the entry point of the program will begin in our case we use <strong>_start</strong> or you can use <strong>main</strong>.</p><p>We simply move the value of decimal 16 or hex 10 into the 64-bit RAX register. We will see in a moment that the processor will use only the lower EAX when we debug in GDB.</p><p>The last piece is just a simple exit routine which we move 60 into RAX and then syscall. It simply returns operation back to the OS.</p><p>Let's compile and link:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-middle"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFu1Dk0PbXPHA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227507149?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=7RI41q89rCAC4Du2j_NN9supgZtEmhygAxS_w1LG6Go"/></div><p>Let's debug in GDB:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-middle"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGQKeM_npZRVA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227529034?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=BXCBy2LzVFQHktOWL-OucgQ4pmRIoc-XAIA9bzGLVYY"/></div><p>Let's set the debugger for intel syntax and set a break on start:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEWg3Q9ytbyKw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227565697?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=58qVPsXEadAXrkRL7A4ZVSYXs85Fv7uhiaoHVPxb6pM"/></div><p>As we can see 16 decimal or hex 10 is about to be moved into EAX but as we can see it has not been completed until we step forward.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGX6OfrhJb9xw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227619555?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=yApSA7OEa52iFkr8v3Y9YlJhRPi7rszTDhE9up-woaI"/></div><p>Now we can view our registers.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFG0dCxLiNapw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1550227646545?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=g9ENJKbK6c7rIn_7QSbWaYZ_CsdAYjRLG5hq0Aj_ymQ"/></div><p>We can see that RAX holds decimal 16 or hex 10 successfully.</p><p>We will spend several weeks on these simple examples so you can get comfortable with how the processor operates and its internal workings.</p>
