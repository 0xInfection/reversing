<h1>Part 8 - General Architecture</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>The x64 processor uses what we refer to as __fastcall. </p><p>The __fastcall calling convention specifies that arguments to functions are to be passed in registers, when possible. This calling convention only applies to the x86 architecture.</p><p>The first two DWORD or smaller arguments that are found in the argument list from left to right are passed in <strong>ecx</strong> and <strong>edx</strong> registers; all other arguments are passed on the stack from right to left.</p><p>Called function pops the arguments from the stack.</p><p>At sign (@) is prefixed to names; an at sign followed by the number of bytes (in decimal) in the parameter list is suffixed to names.</p><p>No case translation performed.</p><p>Here is a simple breakdown to illustrate:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGixhqL7odqYA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1539336219028?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Xx9UCsDsmCSqL3PWXUzoGKn03AdI4gdv8jiyWNS58Og"/></div><p>If you have two parameters you are passing from a function, for example int <strong>x</strong> and int <strong>y</strong> and it is a QWORD, <strong>x</strong> will go into <strong>rcx</strong> and <strong>y</strong> will go into<strong> rdx</strong>. </p><p>If you have five parameters you are passing for example int <strong>a</strong>, int <strong>b</strong>, int <strong>c</strong>, int <strong>d</strong>, int <strong>e</strong> and it is a WORD in length, <strong>a</strong> will go into <strong>cx</strong>, <strong>b</strong> into <strong>dx</strong>, <strong>c</strong> into <strong>r8w</strong>, <strong>d</strong> into r9w and e into the stack.</p><p><br/></p><p>Next week we will dive into boolean instructions!
