For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover.&nbsp;https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial

The SHL command stands for shift left.

Let’s assume the register __al__ holds __01010101b__ which is an 8-bit binary value.&nbsp;Let’s assume the instruction is __shl al, 2__.&nbsp;Below is what transpires as we see the values move two bits to the left.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00010101

00010101

Therefore the new value will be:

10100000

Next week we will dive into SHR! Stay tuned!
