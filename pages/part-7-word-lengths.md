<h1>Part 7 - Word Lengths</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>The x64 architecture is a backwards-compatible extension of the x86 platform. It provides a legacy 32-bit mode, which is identical to x86, and a new 64-bit mode. You can review my legacy x86 tutorial if you would like to get more information right here on LinkedIn.</p><p>The term "x64" includes both AMD 64 and Intel64. The instruction sets are similar.</p><p>x64 extends x86's 8 general-purpose registers to be 64-bit, and adds 8 new 64-bit registers. The 64-bit registers have names beginning with "<strong>r</strong>", so for example the 64-bit extension of <strong>eax</strong> is called <strong>rax</strong>. The new registers are named <strong>r8</strong> through <strong>r15</strong>.</p><p>The lower 32 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits of each register are directly addressable in operands. This includes registers, like <strong>esi</strong>, whose lower 8 bits were not previously addressable. The following table specifies the assembly-language names for the lower portions of 64-bit registers.</p><p>The table below breaks out each bytes distinction.</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHFdX_EmtcB1Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1538735142722?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Sy_VAzyAPcfSGlvo7jOz_M9oB-pbZIYGUPTuKfs5w6E"/></div><p>Operations that output to a 32-bit subregister are automatically zero-extended to the entire 64-bit register. Operations that output to 8-bit or 16-bit subregisters are <em>not</em> zero-extended (this is compatible x86 behavior).</p><p>The high 8 bits of <strong>ax</strong>, <strong>bx</strong>, <strong>cx</strong>, and <strong>dx</strong> are still addressable as <strong>ah</strong>, <strong>bh</strong>, <strong>ch</strong>, <strong>dh</strong>, but cannot be used with all types of operands.</p><p>The instruction pointer, <strong>eip</strong>, and <strong>flags</strong> register have been extended to 64 bits (<strong>rip</strong> and <strong>rflags</strong>, respectively) as well.</p><p>The x64 processor also provides several sets of floating-point registers:</p><ul><li>Eight 80-bit x87 registers.</li><li>Eight 64-bit MMX registers. (These overlap with the x87 registers.)</li><li>The original set of eight 128-bit SSE registers is increased to sixteen.</li></ul><p>Next week we will dive into calling conventions! Stay tuned!</p>
