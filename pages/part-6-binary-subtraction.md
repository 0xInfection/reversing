<h1>Part 6 - Binary Subtraction</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover. https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Before we dive into the architecture lets talk about how we define various bits and how they are structured within the processor.</p><p>In both x64 and x86, we define a byte as 8 bits. We define a word as 16 bits. We define a double word as 32 bits and a quadword as 64 bits. Finally we define a double quadword as 128 bits. </p><p>Intel processors store bytes as what we refer to as "little endian," meaning lower significant bytes are stored in lower memory addresses. Lets give an example of a simple 16-bit or 2 byte value. On disk - 0xAABB. When it goes into memory it is stored as 0xBBAA as I hope this provides a good visual as this concept can be quite confusing.</p><p>Keep in mind, 8 bits make up a byte. 4 bits are also called a nibble which are equivalent to one hex digit.</p><p>Next week we will dive into general architecture! Stay tuned!</p>
