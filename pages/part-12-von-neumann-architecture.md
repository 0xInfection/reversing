ARM is a load and store machine to which the Arithmetic Logic Unit only operates on the registers themselves and any data that needs to be stored out to RAM, the control unit moves the data between memory and the registers which share the same data bus.

The CPU chip of this architecture holds a control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (along with some local memory) and the main memory is in the form of RAM sticks located on the motherboard.

A stored-program digital computer is one that keeps its program instructions, as well as its data, in read-write, random-access memory or RAM.

Next week we will dive into the Instruction Pipeline.
