<h1>Part 41 - Hacking Variables!</h1><p>For a complete table of contents of all the lessons please click below as it will give you a brief of each lesson in addition to the topics it will cover.Â https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Tutorial</p><p>Let's take a look at some branching logic:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGwGjw2t5NS3A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729104643?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=nEa_JzYKlChdOMufjqMcz57E9jhz1h9aklTbnOtoZfc"/></div><p>As we can plainly see we init an int to 1 and if the variable is equal to 1 the first if statement prints a response to standard output.</p><p>Let's compile:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFz1m2DtwG3vg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729192665?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=66r7QEfo9R7fSx40eNTPtXudk62p_WH2jYlAgzesc-E"/></div><p>Let's run:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFler9Tr6IA0A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729212374?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RYJL3FI8f8H5S6JVegUxu8RkcqhAfFs4d0PTqW86jDQ"/></div><p>As we can logically see the first branch is taken. Let's take it into Radare and look around at the assembly:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFpbk6GtjmaYg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729291450?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=JudLnLcGgJw73Ml_dntox-J9fdUX__tFfkM5ayRV0uQ"/></div><p>We can see the branching logic with the aqua colored arrows. At <strong>0x0000114a</strong> we see our first branch being loaded into <strong>rdi</strong>. Take note at <strong>0x00001148</strong> we see a <strong>jne 0x1158</strong>. At <strong>0x00001158</strong> we see our second branch being loaded into <strong>rdi</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>jne</strong> means jump if not equal. This means if what is being compared in <strong>0x00001144</strong> is not equal to 1 (we see <strong>1</strong> being compared to what is in <strong>local_4h</strong> which we know is pseudo code for what is actually in <strong>rbp-0x4</strong>. This should make sense as I went over this in detail last week if you are confused please revisit our last lesson.</p><p>To hack we simply make the <strong>jne</strong> statement to <strong>je</strong> which is jump if equal which we know the <strong>cmp</strong> or comparison is equal so it will now branch to "<strong>A is NOT 1!</strong>".</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEfoHIpbbe6xA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729757650?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=GGKysOMmEExHeQopuR--JEgXl6qWXOEdw_GkgC0N8lk"/></div><p>When we exit Radare we can see we have hacked the binary successfully:</p><div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQH2R_y8IjD3jg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1566729786175?e=1614211200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=E7mfm4pLtyNgvvqWSU213aCoM9WYqh37ws9JQZ9ASFE"/></div><p>Stay tuned!</p>
