Congrats you wrote, compiled and hacked your first C++ program. For the rest of this tutorial I am going to focus on the father of all programming languages from "Hello World" to web servers in the programming language to which ALL modern languages come from C.

Like the variety of religions there are programming languages. Nonetheless there is the ROOT religion or language to which all spawn which is C. I am going to over the next several months teach you C and Reverse Engineer each binary so you have a mastery over the MASTER language of all existence.

When we need to develop in an agile environment we will of course use Java or Python or any of the other rapid development languages however if you are to master Cyber Engineering you MUST become ONE with the WORD to which in digital and cyber terms is the C Programming Language.

Think of C as if you are in church where Python or Java or C\# you are in a secular environment. C will allow TOTAL and complete control over your program or environment where Java or Python will allow only partial control however they are NECESSARY languages in today's rapid development business logic environments.

In our next lesson we begin with the basic "hello world" program as we did in our prior lesson however we now will work with C. Remember Einstein - "__I want to know God's thoughts, the rest are details.__" This is the difference between C and any other language you are sitting at the ROOT of engineering design for portable systems!
