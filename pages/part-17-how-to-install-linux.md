If you do not have Linux installed on a computer within your household, I would suggest installing Virtual Box which is an open-source free virtual environment which you can install on your existing computer to have a version of Linux you can program with.&nbsp;Below is a link to download and install Virtual Box as there are versions for both Windows and Mac.

In addition, you will need a copy of Linux to which I will be working with Ubuntu. Below is a link to download the .iso file to which you will install once you have Virtual Box installed.
